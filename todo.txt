its all about making tracks, celebrating long running tracks.

index page should have anon tracks made today, this week, to date etc all about encouragement...

Add week totals as default in a header somehow?

have a popular suggestion for tags, easy to click and open add?

add peek to day/week/month/year streaks, start this:
	1st attempt add just count of each type per time selected.
	2nd add a simple graph
	3rd add wax graph
	4th add polished glitz!

add remove/edit eventually to past entries.

have a business or personel panel choice.
